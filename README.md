My website is a Valentines day event page. I have inspired from a Swiss Poster Design. 

The header is consist of 4 elements that are; home, events, shop and search. Scrolling the page, you can see three events including; event cooking, event dining and event concert. Only the "love it" buttons under the events category are linked to another html page. 

Lastly, at the end of the html page you can see Contact, About and Store  as a footer.

The text editor I've used is Visual Studio Code and it's build with Github.
